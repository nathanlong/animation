---

An attempt to classify the different types of animation that make up a web experience.

---

## 'Set-Piece'

Self-contained, elaborate animation used to powerful editorial effect or for elevating the experience aesthetically.

Broken down further:

- **Editorial**
  - Prominent animations, often containing a high-level of illustrations that add narrative value to the experience, but in an augmentive fashion, not as the central expeirence.
- **Ambient**
  - Occurs in the background, often not interactive. Adds to the aesthetic tone of the site, reinforcement of visual concepts, or helps the experience feel more 'alive'

## Functional

Conveying information to the user about the state of the system, and updates to it. (Visibility of system status, as a UX heuristic)

- **Reduce Cognitive Load**
  - Reduces confusion by effectively communicating user feedback
- **Allows discoverability (if consistent)**
- **Prevent change blindness**
- **Establish better recall in spacial awareness**
- **Explain, guide, or draw attention through non-verbal cues**
  - Create relationships between elements on the screen
  - Draw focus to critical areas

These can be further broken down into: **Realtime** (immediate direct interaction) and **Non-Realtime** (something occurs after or as as result of interaction).

## Experiential

Refers to a system of interrelated animations that work together to make up a large part, or the entire experience of the system.

---

## Narrative

Tells a story, often without words. Typically this is confined to longer formats of animation like film and cinema â€” the traditional definition of animation.
